A rudimentary Go filetype plugin. Provides syntax files and basic settings for
go files.

This is a fork of some of the vim files originally stored in the main go
repository under misc/vim/.

If you're doing serious go development, you probably want to install a more
full-featured plugin like https://github.com/fatih/vim-go, which includes lots
of useful commands and utilities.

**NOTE**: As of vim 7.4.414, these files have been merged into vim's upstream
runtime files. You only need this plugin if you're running an older version of
vim, or to receive future updates until they're merged into vim.
